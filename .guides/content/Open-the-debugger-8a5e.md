Let's try to use the debugger now. In the file `example.html` in the left hand pane, you can see that we put a `debugger` statement on line 31.

Now you can <a href="debugger/example.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to open this example in another browser tab. When the page is loaded, open the developer tools and then reload the page.

When you are done debugging just close the browser tab and come back to Codio.

### Attention

When you come back, you may find the Codio environnment totally "frozen" and unresponsive. This is due to the debugger which is still running in background. If that is the case, just go back to the tab in which you were debugging the script and stop the debugging session or close completely the tab.
