Before continuing on our JS adventures we need to learn a very useful function : `console.log`.

Do you remember the "console" we saw in the Chrome Developer Tools unit ? (It should be in your projects under the name "chrome-developer-tools" if you want redo it.)

The `console.log` function is how you can print to this web console. It can be very useful to print the values of variables or anything you would like from your JS code.

Here is an example of usage :

```javascript
console.log("Hello from console.");
```

You can see a working example of it in the top left hand pane. In this guide we have added our own console, which you can see in the bottom left pane. This is just to ease your life during the course, and to allow you to see the console output without having to open the developer tools or leave Codio. If you really want to, you can still check the "real" console. If you open it, you will see the same output in it, it should look something like this :
