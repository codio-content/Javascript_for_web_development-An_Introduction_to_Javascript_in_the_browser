# Recap
In the previous units we have seen how to use HTML and CSS to create *static* web pages and style them as we wish. Those page are "frozen" and the only user interaction is through the user clicking on links and visiting other *static* pages.

# In this unit
In this unit, we will see how to make our pages more dynamic and interactive by using Javascript (JS). This unit will only cover the basics of JS in the browser but we will cover more in the next units.
